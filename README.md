# Structurizr for Java extensions

This GitHub repository is a collection of extensions for the [Structurizr for Java](https://github.com/structurizr/java) library that provide a way to extract architectural information from Java code via reflection.

Unfortunately:

- The code in this library is incompatible with newer versions of the `structurizr-core` library.
- The code in this library has some dependencies on Java 8.
- There is very little interest in this library.

Therefore this repo has been archived. The code remains open source, so you are more than welcome to fork it and make your own releases.
